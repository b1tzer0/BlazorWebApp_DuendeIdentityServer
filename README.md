# BlazorWebApp_DuendeIdentityServer
Sample app with basic implementation of Duende IdentityServer

Things of note:
- Uses basic template with both Server Side and WASM Components Enabled.
- Blazor Autostart is turned off
- `ssr:{ disableDomPreservation: true }`
- BFF has been added, but have not figured out the BffAuthenticationStateProvider yet.
- Some elements may not be necessary, pulling from various sources and demos to try to get all the elements to work.
